<h1 align="center">Worlds console</h1>

This is a CLI (command-line interface) app that runs ***Worlds***, a text-based world simulation and role-playing game toolkit. With *Worlds*, you can create a pre-modern (e.g. medieval fantasy) virtual world and play a character in it.

*Worlds* is still in early developmentâ€”it's just an empty shell *(pun intended)*. This CLI app works on MacOS and Linux. Later on I plan on making it playable via a web interface as well.

You can follow its development in the blog series "Building text-based game in Ruby":
