<h1 align="center">Worlds console</h1>

This is a CLI (command-line interface) app that runs ***Worlds***, a text-based world simulation and role-playing game toolkit. With *Worlds*, you can create a pre-modern (e.g. medieval fantasy) virtual world and play a character in it.

*Worlds* is still in early development. Eventually it will be split off into a Ruby gem, and it will be playable via a web interface as well.
